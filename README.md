# F767ZI-FanControl - Nucleo-based PWM fan controller

This project is prepared as Microprocessor Systems course on Poznan University of Technology.

## Features

 - Built for Nucleo-F767ZI (might be compatible with Nucleo-F746ZG with minimal tweaking)
 - Based on STM32Cube HAL with STM32CubeMX-generated code
 - STM32Cube-compatible project
 - using custom P-type controller (might change real soon)
 - AvaloniaUI-based desktop app with serial connection to the board
